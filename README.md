  <h1>API Testing with Postman</h1>
  <p>As part of my software testing development, I've honed my skills in API testing using Postman. This powerful tool has enabled me to effectively validate the functionality of various APIs. I have developed a strong foundation in API testing methodologies and best practices. I am confident in my ability to effectively test APIs, identify defects, and contribute to the overall quality of software applications</p>
  
  <h3>Key skills:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating and running collections</li>
    <li>Testing REST APIs using HTTP methods(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)</li>
    <li>Creating and using variables</li>
    <li>Making chain requests </li>
    <li>Writing assertions with JavaScript</li>    
  </ul>
<br></br>
  <h2>Public API Experience</h2>
  
<p>To gain hands-on experience, I've actively worked with various public APIs, such as <strong>Restful Booker</strong>, <strong>Czy IT jest dla mnie</strong>, <strong>TRELLO</strong>. Through these experiences, I've honed my skills in API testing and developed a deep understanding of real-world API interactions.</p>
