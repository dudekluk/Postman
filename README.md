  <h2>API Testing with Postman</h2>
In my journey as a software tester, I’ve developed strong skills in API testing using Postman. This powerful tool allowed me to effectively validate the functionality of various APIs. I have a solid foundation in API testing methodologies and best practices, enabling me to identify defects and contribute to the overall quality of software applications.
  

  <h3>Key skills:</h3>
  
* Testing REST APIs using HTTP methods(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
* Creating and running collections
* Creating and using variables
* Making chain requests
* Writing assertions with JavaScript   

<h2>Public API Experience</h2>
  
To gain hands-on experience, I’ve worked with various public APIs, such as <strong>Restful Booker</strong>, <strong>Czy IT jest dla mnie</strong>, <strong>TRELLO</strong>. These experiences have sharpened my API testing skills and deepened my understanding of real-world API interactions.
